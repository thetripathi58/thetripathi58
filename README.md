### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working at Dassault Systèmes as a software developer.

👨‍🔬 I'm a CS student who loves to learning new things everyday.

🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development and backend development, I guess?

All my life I have been observant on how to make the world around me simpler or more productive. Software engineering gave me the vehicle to leverage my skills and contribute on a global scale. Transforming a hobby into a career has been an incredible and rewarding experience.
